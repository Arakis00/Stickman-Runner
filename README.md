# Stickman-Runner
A quirky side scrolling obstacle avoidance game using XNA/C#.

# Notes
This was done as part of a group project for school.  It involves a running stickman that has to avoid hurdles by either jumping or ducking.  The game finishes when either all 3 levels are completed successfully or if 3 total obstacles are failed.  If a certain number of obstacles are successfully completed in a row, the screen will scroll quicker and a scoring multiplier will be activated.  If an obstacle is hit, the multiplier and speed will reset to 1x.
